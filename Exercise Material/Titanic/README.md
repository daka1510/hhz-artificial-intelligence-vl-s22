# How to prepare data, and build and deploy classification models in Watson Studio
- add notebooks and data file (_train.csv_) to your Watson Studio project. 
- work through _Titanic Data Preparation.ipynb_. 
- work through _Titanic Modeling, Evaluation and Deployment.ipynb_
- Use _train_dummies.csv_ only as a backup file for running the second notebook if you did not manage to run the first notebook!

For local deployment, see https://github.com/daka1510/hhz-artificial-intelligence-vl-s22/tree/main/Exercise%20Material/Titanic/Local%20Deployment#how-to-train-and-deploy-a-model-locally
