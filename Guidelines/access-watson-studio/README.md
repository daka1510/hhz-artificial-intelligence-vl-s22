## How can I access Watson Studio?


## Regions
_Watson Studio_ is hostet at https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com. It can be accessed via four different regions (Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Tokyo). We recommend to select the region closest to your location for the exercises (Frankfurt).

## Login / Registration
On the home page, you can either _Log in_ with your existing credentials or create a new account. To provision a new Watson Studio instance,
- Register for an IBM Cloud trial account (https://cloud.ibm.com/registration/trial)
  - if the registration fails because you previously registered a premium account, use another mail address as a temporary workaround
  - you are not required to enter any payment details for a trial account
- Log in to (http://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/) with the account you created
- Upon first login, you will be prompted to provision the required services to run Watson Studio

## General troubleshooting advice
- clear cookies and/or use incognito browser mode
